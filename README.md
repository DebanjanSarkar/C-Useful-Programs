# C-Useful-Programs
This repository contains some useful C programs, such as linked lis, stacks, queue, binary tree implementation in C, with all its operations, simulated thorugh menu driven programs.
All the functions related to operations are custom made by me, using my ideas, and they can be used as template files for work and competitive programming in C.
It also contains some other programs related to file handling of structures, in Binary mode, so that someone trying to get into it, can use it as reference.
Also, it contains some more variety of programs, all created accoridng to my ideas!
